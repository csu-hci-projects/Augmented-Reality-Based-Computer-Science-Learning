        <p class="lead text-light">Education is the cornerstone upon which civilized societies are built. For thousands of years, education has been improving using various technologies. From word-of-mouth and stone tablets to books and computers, people are always trying to find innovative new ways to pass on information to the next generation using the technology of their time. Well, technology has progressed by leaps and bounds over the last half century, and people are just now catching up antiquated educative practices to better mesh with existing technologies. In 2022, online learning and online school are already commonplace, but is this the end-all of technology in the classroom? This project is aimed to discover what new possibilities are out there with the cutting-edge world of Augmented Reality (AR) and especially how it relates to education and teaching people more effectively.
