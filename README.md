To run this project, download Android studio and an Android emulator if you do not own an Android cell phone. Run the Gradle build using Java 8, and ensure there are no build errors. Note that your cell phone or selected Android emulator must support AR technology and have the most recent ARCore updates downloaded in order to run. From there, run the app on either the emulator or your personal cell phone. The app's UI is intuitive and self-explanatory.
